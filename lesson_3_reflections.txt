When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When you would like to share your code with others and allow them to make changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You might not be ready for the changes to be included in your code. So you have control
	of when you pull your code into your project.
