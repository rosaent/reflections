When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When you would like to share your code with others and allow them to make changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You might not be ready for the changes to be included in your code. So you have control
	of when you pull your code into your project.
 
Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches.  WHen would you use one instead of
another?
	A branch happens on a single repository.  A clone is a copy of a repository either on your
	local machine or from Github. Forks are clones within GitHub.  You would use a branch in 
	your local repository when you want to experiment or add new features and don't want to 
	impact your current branch.  You would use a clone when you want to make a copy of a local
	repository or a repository from GitHub. You would use a fork when you want to copy from one 
	GitHub repository to another GitHub repository.  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	That way when you make updates, you are making updates to the latest version of the code
	otherwise, you will get out of sync and could reintroduce problems that have already been
	fixed.
