What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git creates metadata to track the files within the repository.  To set up your location as part of version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository?  What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is a logical holding place for new files that can be committed to the repository while the working
	directory is physical location of where your files are stored.  It shows the files that will be committed to the
	repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
       By using GIT commands diff and status to verify what files have been modified and have been staged for commit so 
       you can verify that you only have one logical change per commit.
